  <h1>The Internet is under attack!</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p><em>Despite overwhelming support for net neutrality from the public, the FCC <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/07/how-title-ii-goes-beyond-net-neutrality-to-protect-internet-users-from-isps/">still plans to roll back Title II classification of broadband Internet providers that protects consumers</a>. But you have one more chance. Tell the FCC we need net neutrality. We have until August 14th. </em></p>

    <p>Government programs, such as the Lifeline Program, provide telecommunications services like phones and internet to low-income, elderly and disabled people and people living in rural areas that either don’t have access to or can’t afford these resources. Under Title II, Broadband internet is considered a vital telecommunications service. This allows those programs to provide internet to populations that need it.</p>

    <p><em>However, this benefits all consumers, not just vulnerable populations.</em></p>

    <p>This Title II classification has required internet companies, like Comcast, CenturyLink, and Wave, to provide quality service without blocking, throttling, or discriminating against content, and to provide that service at reasonable rates to consumers. Ensuring affordable and fast internet for all consumers and a fair digital playing field for businesses is made possible through the Title II classification.</p>

    <p>For this reason, we are urging the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to maintain broadband internet as a covered service under these programs. Please provide your public comment stating:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Your support for maintaining the classification of broadband internet as a telecommunications service under Title II</li>
      <li>How you benefit from affordable and accessible internet service</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We have a unique opportunity. The Seattle's Community Technology Advisory Board submitted a public comment to the Federal Communications Commission. We have until August 14th to compile an addendum of additional public comments. Many people did not have enough time to comment on proposed changes. This is how you can be heard. Submit comments using the link below by August 14th.</p>

    <p>Are you a vulnerable community? Does your job, healthcare, education, or community participation depend on access to the internet? Tell your story!</p>
